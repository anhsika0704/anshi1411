**User:**
analysis above and design all this based on given data 

To get started, I have a few clarifying questions:

What purpose will this AI character serve? (e.g., game character, virtual assistant, story character)
Do you have any initial ideas about the character's personality or appearance?
Are there any specific traits or capabilities you want this character to have?

The more details you can provide, the better I can help you create a unique and interesting AI character design.
